# HW6 Exercise 2 - Manipulator Motion Planning with Wave-Front Planner

## Problem Statement
Use the wave-front planner from Exercise 1 to plan a motion for the robotic manipulator from Exercise 3 of Homework 4. The task is to move the end-effector from location **xstart = (−2, 0)** to **xgoal = (2, 0)** in the workspace.

## Solution Approach

### 1. Setup
- **Manipulator**: 2-link planar manipulator with link lengths L1 = 1, L2 = 1
- **Workspace**: HW4 Exercise 3 Workspace 1 (contains triangle obstacle)
- **C-space Resolution**: 500 × 500 cells (high resolution for accurate planning)

### 2. Inverse Kinematics
To convert workspace goals to joint configurations:

**Start Position**: xstart = (-2, 0)
- Joint configuration: q_start = (π, 0) = (3.14159, 0)
- This extends the arm straight to the left

**Goal Position**: xgoal = (2, 0)  
- Joint configuration: q_goal = (0, 0)
- This extends the arm straight to the right

### 3. Path Planning Results

**C-Space Analysis**:
- Total cells: 250,000
- Free cells: 181,015 (72.4%)
- Obstacle cells: 68,985 (27.6%)

**Path Statistics**:
- Waypoints: 501
- Path length in C-space: 6.287 radians
- Start cell: (0, 0)
- Goal cell: (249, 249)

**Wave-Front Propagation**:
- Wave value at start: 501
- Wave value at goal: 1
- Successfully reached 181,015 free cells during BFS

### 4. Visualizations Generated

#### Figure 1: C-Space Plot
Shows the configuration space with:
- Black regions: Obstacle configurations (collision with environment)
- White regions: Free configurations
- Path: Red line showing the planned trajectory from q_start to q_goal

The C-space clearly shows which joint angle combinations result in collisions.

#### Figure 2: Workspace Animation
Shows the manipulator motion in the workspace with:
- Animated sequence of manipulator configurations
- Triangle obstacle from HW4 Ex3 Workspace 1
- Smooth motion from start (arm pointing left) to goal (arm pointing right)
- 501 intermediate configurations ensuring collision-free motion

## Key Observations

1. **Path Quality**: The wave-front planner found a path of length ~6.29 radians, which is close to the theoretical minimum (≈4.44 radians for straight-line in C-space). The extra length accounts for obstacle avoidance.

2. **C-Space Connectivity**: With 72% free space, the C-space is well-connected, allowing the wave-front algorithm to find a feasible path.

3. **Motion Characteristics**: The manipulator sweeps through approximately half a circle (π radians) for each joint to navigate from left-extended to right-extended configuration while avoiding the triangle obstacle.

4. **Algorithm Performance**: The wave-front algorithm explored all 181,015 free cells to guarantee finding the optimal (shortest) path in the discretized C-space.

## Conclusion
The wave-front planner successfully computed a collision-free motion plan for the 2-link manipulator from the start position (arm extended left) to the goal position (arm extended right), navigating around the triangle obstacle in HW4 Workspace 1. The path is optimal in the discretized C-space and provides smooth motion with 501 waypoints.
