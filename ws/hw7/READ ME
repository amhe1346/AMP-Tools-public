to run 
You need to set the library path before running. In your WSL terminal, run:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./install/ubuntu22/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./build/bin/main-hw7

This sets the path to find the libyaml-cpp.so.0.8 library that your program needs.

rebuild 

wsl bash -c 
  "cd /home/aeheerten/code/AMP-Tools-public && cmake --build build"
